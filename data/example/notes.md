# Strategy Meeting Notes — 2026-02-20

**Attendees:** CEO, VP Product, VP Eng, Head of Sales, Head of CS

## Key Decisions

- **Go/no-go on EMEA:** Approved exploratory phase. Hire one AE in London by end of Q2.
- **AI summaries priority:** Moved to P0. Customers citing it as top-requested feature.
- **Mobile v2:** Ship iOS first, Android fast-follow. Target beta by mid-April.

## Metrics Discussed

- Q1 MAU hit 12,500 — 23% above Q4. Strongest quarter yet.
- Revenue at $485K, but enterprise pipeline is thin. Need more outbound.
- Churn dropped to 4.2% — CS team's onboarding revamp is working.
- NPS jumped to 62. One customer said: "SyncSpace cut our meeting time in half. We actually know what's happening now."

## Concerns

- Engineering bandwidth is tight. Current team can't absorb SSO + AI + mobile simultaneously.
- Competitor Threadly just raised $30M — expect aggressive pricing.
- EMEA data residency requirements need legal review before committing.

## Resource Ask

- **Approved in principle:** 3 senior engineers + 1 senior designer.
- Final headcount tied to Q2 board approval. CEO will champion.

## Action Items

- VP Eng: Scope SSO/SCIM sprint by March 7.
- VP Product: Finalize AI summaries spec with design by March 14.
- Head of Sales: Present enterprise pipeline plan at next sync.
