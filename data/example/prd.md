# SyncSpace v2 — Product Requirements Document

## Problem

Distributed teams waste 3–5 hours per week context-switching between chat, docs, tasks, and video calls. Information gets siloed in tool-specific threads, decisions are lost, and new team members take weeks to ramp up. Existing solutions either try to replace every tool (causing adoption friction) or add yet another layer on top (causing notification fatigue).

## Solution

SyncSpace is a lightweight collaboration hub that connects a team's existing tools into a single, searchable activity stream. Rather than replacing Slack, Notion, or Jira, SyncSpace threads related updates together — a design comment in Figma, the linked Jira ticket, and the Slack discussion — so every decision has full context.

## Target Users

- **Primary:** Engineering and product teams at mid-market SaaS companies (50–500 employees).
- **Secondary:** Cross-functional leadership who need visibility without micromanaging.

## Key Features (v2)

1. **Smart Threads** — AI-powered grouping of related activity across tools.
2. **Decision Log** — One-click capture of decisions with automatic stakeholder tagging.
3. **Pulse Dashboards** — Real-time team health metrics (blockers, velocity, sentiment).
4. **Enterprise SSO & SCIM** — Required for our upmarket push into 500+ seat accounts.
5. **AI Meeting Summaries** — Auto-generated recaps pushed to the relevant thread after every call.
